							  <p>A safer answer may be just to have the application run another query once it returns from this one. As long as it's done on the back end, the performance penalty should be worth the simplicity of managing the development in groups of people, and it's closer in accordance to standards than some crazy feature with edge cases. I'd rather the edge cases be in my code, and avoid them on the platforms. just my opinion don't freak out :) </p>
